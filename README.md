# Project Overview

This project exists to demonstrate some common unit tests written with the [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) library.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

# Running the Tests

Viewing the results of the tests is as simple as loading the project's index.html file in your browser. Doing so automatically runs the tests defined in `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.

If you want to see the current out of the tests you can go here: https://codemunkee.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/.

We check for a few things:

- RSS Feeds are defined correctly
- The Menu functionality (it's hidden by default and shows up when clicked)
- Feeds show up when the page loads
- We can see new feed data when requested

Testing is fun!
